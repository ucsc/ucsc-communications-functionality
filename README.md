# ucsc-communications-functionality

Custom Functionality Plugin for UCSC's Communications website on the CampusPress network.

This plugin currently provides two short codes:

- `[style-definition]`: Displays the style definitions for each Editorial Style Guide post type
- `[style-archive]`: Displays a loop of the style guide posts on the Editorial Style Guide page

This plugin also saves and loads ACF field groups to and from the plugin's `acf-json` folder.
